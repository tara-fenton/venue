## Any things you plan to fix or features you plan to add

- Clean up Spotifyâ€™s sample code for login
- Allow users to collaborate on playlists
- When adding a venue it will add the playlist it created
- Design to match wireframes


## Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost

- You need a Spotify premium account. I used a developer key to demonstrate the playing song, it will not work on heroku. Running locally, if you want to test it out you can get a key from https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/# and click on the GET YOUR WEB PLAYBACK SDK ACCESS TOKEN button. Paste the key in track.ejs line 21 const token = ''   Also you would need to run the schema.sql and seed.sql files for the database setup.
